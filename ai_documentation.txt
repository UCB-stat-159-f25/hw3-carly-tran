I utilized ChatGPT for help regarding the tests I created for readligo.py and utils.py. My tests were not passing so I referenced chatGPT and it identified that the tests were failing because the functions weren’t properly modularized or imported. With its help, I moved those functions into a new module ligotools/utils.py, fixed the import paths in the notebook, and ensured dependencies were correctly imported. After these changes, all pytest checks ran successfully.

ChatGPT also assisted my help with debugging problems I had with MyST. It verified that the structure of my myst.yml file was correct
